The first thing this program will be do is check the PrimeNumbers.txt file to fill up the cache.

PrimeChecker then takes in a username and sequence of numbers from the user, 
if the sequence entered is valid (contains no spaces, letters or special characters) 
then the sequence will be broken into multiple different numbers, 
these numbers are printed onto the terminal so they can be viewed.

These numbers will then be checked to see if they are in the cache as it should only have prime numbers,
if they are not in the cache then the numbers will be checked to see if they are prime, 
if they are prime they will then be stored in the cache and printed onto the terminal.

The cache will then be saved to a text file called PrimeNumbers.txt which will be in the 
same folder as the code, only unique prime numbers will be added to the cache or file.
